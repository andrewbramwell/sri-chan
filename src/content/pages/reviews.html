                    Visited Sri-Chan Thai Massage on four occasions now. When compared to previous massages there is a significant and noticeable change in how I feel following. Its not just about the relaxation! Knots from under shoulder blades gone allowing a larger range of motion through my chest. Twinged lower back and following one session this was near fully improved. The massage itself can be painful but it's very well worth it!

                    Probably the best massage I’ve ever had - and I’ve had a few! May is incredible at what she does - she will adapt to you and listen to what you and your body needs/wants. I left feeling completely zen - rested but also energised at the same time. Pain, tension, anxiety all melt away - I advise at least 60 but ideally 90 minutes for a treatment if possible. It’s been the best use of my time and money visiting. Wonderful!

                    I had an incredible experience at this spa! From the moment I walked in, May was welcoming and professional. The massage itself was amazing – May really listened to my needs and worked out all the tension in my shoulders and back. I felt completely relaxed and rejuvenated afterward. The atmosphere was calming, and the room was peaceful and clean. I highly recommend this place if you’re looking for a top-notch massage.

                    May is really an expert in her craft! The massage was by far the best I’ve ever had! Although quite painful as there were knots in my shoulders, I really appreciated the fact that she didn’t just rub over them, and I left there feeling much better. I will definitely be back, next time hopefully my body will be ready for a relaxing massage. Don’t hesitate to book!

                    I’ve had several massages in my lifetime being a Professional Golfer but I have never experienced massages like May provides. Whether it is a traditional Thai massage or a Deep tissue, Mays ability and knowledge of your body is unbelievable. I just wish I found May years ago! Highly recommended if you want to look after your body & want 5 star treatment.

                    I was so very impressed with a 5 stars treatment for my Swedish massage. May has performed a superb back, shoulder and neck massage for me. Her knowledge and technique was outstanding. It was relaxing and relief tension and pain which I had suffered for sometime. I felt so much better after the treatment in a such nice and relaxing atmosphere.

                    I had the most amazing deep tissue massage with May. Not only was she kind and made me feel super comfortable, but she also listened to my body and helped relieve so much tension. I highly recommend! Thank you May.
