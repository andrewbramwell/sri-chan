                    May is really an expert in her craft! The massage was by far the best I’ve ever had! Although quite painful as there were knots in my shoulders, I really appreciated the fact that she didn’t just rub over them, and I left there feeling much better. I will definitely be back, next time hopefully my body will be ready for a relaxing massage. Don’t hesitate to book!

                    I’ve had several massages in my lifetime being a Professional Golfer but I have never experienced massages like May provides. Whether it is a traditional Thai massage or a Deep tissue, Mays ability and knowledge of your body is unbelievable. I just wish I found May years ago! Highly recommended if you want to look after your body & want 5 star treatment.

                    I was so very impressed with a 5 stars treatment for my Swedish massage. May has performed a superb back, shoulder and neck massage for me. Her knowledge and technique was outstanding. It was relaxing and relief tension and pain which I had suffered for sometime. I felt so much better after the treatment in a such nice and relaxing atmosphere.
